👋 Hi there, I'm Nick! 👋

### 🤓 About Me

I'm the creative behind the "Create Yourself Podcast" and a total breakdancing and music enthusiast. In a past life, I was a lead 360 consultant within the tech industry, but I quickly discovered the magic of coding and fell head over heels in love with its limitless potential. Now, I use my knack for interpersonal communication to create dynamic solutions that bridge the gap between tech and the human experience. 🤪

### 🔭 What I'm Working On

Right now, I'm pouring all of my energy into boosting my frontend skills to score my dream job as a Frontend Developer! I'm already feeling the excitement of what the future holds and am beyond stoked to put my new knowledge into action. Can you feel the magic in the air? I sure can! 🪄
