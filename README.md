👋 Hi there, I'm Nick! 👋

### 🤓 About Me

I'm the creative behind the "Create Yourself Podcast" and a total breakdancing and music enthusiast. In a past life, I was a lead 360 consultant within the tech industry, but I quickly discovered the magic of coding and fell head over heels in love with its limitless potential. Now, I use my knack for interpersonal communication to create dynamic solutions that bridge the gap between tech and the human experience. 🤪
