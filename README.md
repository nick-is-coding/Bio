HELLO! üëãüèº 

![1665517978486](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96067193/213294695-c3e042ac-a9f0-4ece-b2b7-775b316b3585.jpeg)

If you have stumbled upon my profile, here are a couple things I'd like to share with you! 

I am an avid learner, leader, and builder. I've spent the last couple of years as a 360 recruiter where I managed and spoke to Clients and Candidates within the Tech industry. I led the backend team which consisted of 3 incredible people and helped build out strong processes that enabled them to be more efficient and hit their goals. 

Now, my current focus is on the Frontend (React, JS, HTML, CSS). I'm the type of person that loves to be thrown into the fire so that I can have the opportunity and challenge to rise from the ashes! 

Professionally: 
- Working hard every day (working 9-5) on my skills as a developer. 
- Technologies: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Git, APIs -- next I am learning React and Swift! 

Personally: 
- A HUGE creative dabbler!
- Dabbles: Dance (Breakdancer, HipHop, Modern), Art, Music, and more!
